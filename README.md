## Project Overview  
*Weightless Odyssey* is a real-time simulation game where players assess and resolve critical system failures in a spacecraft. Players must also predict the motion and risk of interstellar bodies and space debris during interstellar travel. This game combines critical thinking and risk assessment with survival mechanics. It was succesfully submitted for the 2024 NASA Space Apps Challenge

### Focus & Main Ideas  
- **Health Effects in Microgravity**:  
  - Muscle Atrophy  
  - Osteoporosis  
  - Fluid Shift  
  - Cardiovascular Deconditioning  
  - Immune System Suppression  
  - Radiation Exposure  

- **Asteroid Characteristics & Motion Prediction**  
  Players assess and avoid asteroid impacts through prediction models.

- **Critical Failure Assessment**  
  Players react to and resolve issues such as:
  - Oxygen module failure  
  - Food contamination  
  - Power overload  
  - Thruster failure  

### Gameplay  
1. Players begin orbiting Earth, performing tasks and managing their health.
2. They embark on a long-distance space journey, encountering various interstellar threats.
3. Players face critical failures and must make decisions through thorough assessment and knowledge.
4. They manage their **Physical** and **Mental Health** metrics through regular maintenance.

### How to Win  
The objective is to survive the journey. The game features customizable survival duration settings, allowing players to set an end goal to win.

## Inspiration  
This game was inspired by the real conditions of the **James Webb Space Telescope**, which was struck by a meteoroid between May 22-24. The game proposes a theoretical solution to avoid such incidents in space travel.

### Asteroids Prediction Model  
Throughout the journey, players assess the motion of rogue space debris and adjust their trajectory to avoid damage. Failure to do so may result in mission failure.
